The sliding window is a standard method for solving coding interview questions.

It often applies to problems related to arrays and strings.

Here's how it works: {1/7}

A sliding window is a subarray that moves from left to right through an array.

The window is defined by 2 pointers representing its left and right bound.

The window size can be fixed or variable.

{2/7}

For fixed size, the idea is to efficiently calculate some information about the elements in the window.

For variable size, the idea is to efficiently find the best window fitting some constraint.

Let's consider a sample problem where the size is fixed.

{3/7}

Suppose we have an array of n integers and a window's size.

The goal is to maintain and report the smallest value inside each window as this moves.

The brute force solution would be to inspect each window, which implies a lot of repeated work.

{4/7}

The key to solving the problem efficiently is to maintain a queue that satisfies 2 invariants:

- each element is larger than the previous one

- the 1st element is always the minimum inside the window

{5/7}

The queue needs to be updated after each window's move.

The elements from the end are removed until the last one is smaller than the new one, or the queue gets empty. 

The 1st element is removed if it is not inside the window anymore. 

The new element is added.

The algorithm's time complexity depends on the queue's number of inserts and removal operations.

Since each array element is added exactly once and removed at most once, the algorithm works in O(n) time.
