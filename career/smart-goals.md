Whatever you want to achieve:

âž¤ complete a side project
âž¤ get a new job as developer
âž¤ learn a new programming skill

you need to have specific goals to succeed.

I use an effective approach.

Setting SMART goals.

// THREAD // ðŸ§µ

What are SMART goals?

A powerful goal setting framework.

SMART stands for:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bounded

Why are SMART goals useful for me ?

- increase my psychological response to the goals

- increase my probability of following through the goals

- give me a structured way to assess if my goals are appropriate

What a SMART goal concretely is ?

The best way to understang is proceeding by examples.

Let's suppose you want to get a new job or learning a new skill.

And let's check what each part of the acronym means. SPECIFIC

A strong goal must be specific.

The more you're specific the better is.

Instead of targeting a generic good job, target a specific position at a specific company.

Instead of having as goals to learn algorithms, have learning graph algorithms. MEASURABLE

You need to know when you've accomplished your goal.

If your goal is to get a job at XY company, it is measurable by evaluating if you get the job.

If your goal is learning graph algorithms, it is measurable by considering if you solved N graph problems. ACHIEVABLE

A realistic goal shall be achievable with your resources.

You need honest self-reflection, analyzing how much work you have to do and how much effort you can put in.

It is probably not achievable get a job at Google in 1 months preparing only 1 hour per week. Relevant

Motivation is important.

If you don't care about a goal, itâ€™s unlikely youâ€™ll achieve it.

If youâ€™re looking for a job right now, it's relevant to you study for interviews.

If you need a programming language to finish a project, it's relevant to you learn it. Time-bounded

If you donâ€™t have a deadline for your goal, youâ€™ll keep putting it off.

This is crucial for success.

It helps you to say how much you need to work every day to achieve your goal. Wrap up

This is really crucial.

Once you have a high level big SMART goal, you need to recursively break it down into smaller and smaller pieces.

You can set smaller SMART goals until you have ultimately broken down all the work in 1 hour to 1 day blocks.
