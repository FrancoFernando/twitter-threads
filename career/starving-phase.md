After 15 years as developer, I can tell you a thing:

you'll have starving phases in your career.

Good news: you can overcome them!

You have 2 possible ways:

1. creating optionality
2. making impact

Let me explain you how.

Optionality

This means creating choices for yourself in your career.

The more options you're able to create, the more possibilities you have to get what you want.

Creating options doesn't mean that you'll be forced to change job, or to do anything in particular. It simply gives you more possibilities.

For example, if you're not happy with

- your management
- your scope of work
- your company direction

you have the choice of leaving to join another company or find another job. How to create more options?

1. becoming an effective developer who always brings value

2. attracting recruiters with a strong inbound process (i.e. a well set LinkedIn profile)

3. connecting with people and making allies to get access to a job even before it is posted

The 3rd point is often very underrated, but this is how I got my current job

I was referred to the hiring manager even before the position was opened.

Always try to build trusty and worthwhile connection around you. Impact

This means creating more value at your current company.

The more value you create, the more leverage you have to:

- get promoted
- work on interesting projects
- increase your compensation and perks

Many people I've seen moving up very quickly in their careers contributed in a disproportionate level relative to their peers.

They were bringing more value and they received more value.

But how to make more impact ?

There are 3 steps. acquiring new skills

2. leveraging your existing skills

3. earning influence with the people around you

The last point is very important.

Only influencing other people and getting them working with you, you'll be really able to have an outsized impact.
