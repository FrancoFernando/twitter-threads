There are 2️⃣ groups of data structures:

▶️ linear data structures like arrays, list, queues
▶️ non linear data structures like trees and graphs

Do yo know how all these data structures differ?

Keep reading this thread for the answer. Elements arrangements

Elements of linear data structures are sequentially connected and each element can be traversed in a single run.

Elements of non linear data structures are hierarchically connected and are structured in different levels. Levels

Linear data structures does not have any hierarchy, and all the elements are organized in a single level.

In non linear data structures the elements are arranged in multiple levels. Traversal

Linear data structures can be traversed completely in a single run.

Non linear data structures are more difficult to traverse and require multiple runs to be traversed completely. Memory utilization

Linear data structures usually require that the necessary amount of memory is declared in advance which is not so efficient (except linked lists).

Non linear data structures use memory more efficiently and don't require a memory declaration in advance. Time compexity

The time complexity of most common operations for a linear data structure grow linearly with its size.

The time complexity of most common operations for non-linear data structures often stay the same as the input size increase. Examples

Common linear data structures are:

- array
- lists
- queues
- stacks

Common non linear data structures are:

- trees
- graphs
- maps
- tries
