Graphs are one of the most flexible data structures.

They can capture every real-world data and model relationships between them.

Here 1️⃣7️⃣ basic definitions you should know about graphs.

A thread.



1️⃣ Vertex: a single unit of data. A graph consists of a finite set of vertices.

2️⃣ Edge: a connection between 2 vertices. Two vertices connected by an edge are said to be adjacent.

3️⃣ Order: number of vertices in the graph.

4️⃣ Size: number of edges in the graph. 5️⃣ Isolated vertex: a vertex that is not connected to any other vertices in the graph.

6️⃣ Vertex degree: number of edges incident to the vertex. An isolated vertex has 0 degree.

7️⃣ Self-loop: an edge from a vertex to itself.

8️⃣ Multi-edge: an edge occurring multiple times. 9️⃣ Directed graph: a graph where all the edges have a direction indicating which are the start and the end vertices.

1️⃣0️⃣ Undirected graph: a graph where all edges have no direction.

1️⃣1️⃣ Weighted graph: a graph where each edge has assigned a numerical value or weight. 1️⃣2️⃣ Unweighted graph: a graph where all edges have no weights.

1️⃣3️⃣ Sparse graph: a graph where only a small fraction of the possible vertex pairs are connected by an edge.

1️⃣4️⃣ Dense graph: a graph where where a large fraction of the vertex pairs are connected by edges. 1️⃣5️⃣ Acyclic graph: a graph not containing any cycle between its vertices. Trees are connected, acyclic undirected graphs.

1️⃣6️⃣ Cyclic graph: a graph containing cycles between its vertices.

1️⃣7️⃣ DAG: a Directed Acyclic Graph. Useful to model data with precedence contraints.
