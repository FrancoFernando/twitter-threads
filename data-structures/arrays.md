Introduction

âž” An array is a contiguous block of memory storing elements of the same type.

âž” Primitive data structure, but a building block for many others (i.e. queues, stacks).

âž” Linear data structure where the elements are stored sequentially

Indexing

âž” elements can be accessed in costant time by using an integer index

âž” the index of the first element is 0

âž” the index of the other elements represent their offset to 0

âž” accessing an index exceeding the array size cause a memory access error



Static vs Dynamic

âž” Static arrays have fixed size that can never be changed. The number of elements they hold shall be defined in advance.

âž” Dynamic arrays have the capability to resize when adding more elements. Typically a dynamic array doubles in size when it get full.



Multidimensional Arrays

âž” arrays whose elements are arrays

âž” the dimension is given by the number of nested arrays

âž” elements are accessed using n indexes, one for each dimension

âž” the total number of elements is computed multiplying the size of all the dimensions

âž” a 2D array is used to represent a matrix, elements are accessed using 2 indexes

âž” multidimensional arrays are still a single contiguous block of memory

âž” A[50] is equivalent to A[10][5] where element are accessed using code like A[i + (5 * j)] instead of A[i][j]

Pros and cons

+ Fast lookups: retrieving an element at a given index takes O(1) time

+ Cache-friendly: elements are next to each other in memory, making an efficient use of cache

- Adding and removing elements is not possible for static arrays and slow for dynamic

Main operations

âž” Access an element (r/w) using its index takes O(1) time

âž” Add an element is not possible for static arrays or requires a right-shift all the elements on its right for dynamic. This takes O(n). âž” Remove an element is not possible for static arrays or requires a or left-shift all the elements on its right for dynamic. This takes O(n).

âž” Search for an item require to traverse the array in O(n). For sorted elements this can be reduced to O(logn) using binary search. âž” appending an item is a valid operation only for dynamic arrays

âž” when the array is full, each resizing takes O(n) time to copy all existing elements

âž” but this happen so rarely that the amortized time of appending a new element is still O(1)
