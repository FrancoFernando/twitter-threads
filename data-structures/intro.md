Understanding data structures is essential for any software developer.

The 8 must to know are:

âž” Arrays
âž” Lists
âž” Stacks
âž” Queues
âž” Sets
âž” Trees
âž” Graphs
âž” Hash tables

Here is an introduction including time complexity of the main operations.

Arrays

âž” Primitive data structure
âž” Values are all of the same type
âž” Linear data structure, fixed in size
âž” Values are stored consecutively in memory
âž” Building block for many other data structures
âž” Dynamic arrays are a variant that resize themselves when necessary

The average time complexity of the most common operations on arrays are:

âž” Access: O(1)
âž” Insertion: O(n)
âž” Deletion: O(n)
âž” Search: O(n)

Lists

âž” Linear collection of nodes
âž” Each node contain values and a pointer (or reference) to the next node
âž” Linear data structure, dynamic in size
âž” Base building block for other data structures
âž” Double Linked lists contain also a pointer to the previous node

The average time complexity of the most common operations on a single linked list are:

âž” Access: O(n)
âž” Insertion: O(1) provided reference to the previous node
âž” Deletion: O(1) provided reference to the previous and next nodes
âž” Search: O(n)

Queues

âž” Linear data structure, dynamic in size
âž” Can be backed by an array or by a linked list
âž” Process values according to a First in first out policy
âž” Can be implemented with different additional traits: double ended or circular queues
âž” Useful for processing tasks

Average time complexity of the most common operations on a queue are:

âž” Access: O(n)
âž” Insertion: O(1)
âž” Deletion: O(1)
âž” Search: O(n)

Stacks

âž” Linear data structure, dynamic in size
âž” Can be backed by an array, by a linked list or by a dequeue
âž” Process values according to a Last in first out policy
âž” Useful for parsing and undo operations

Average time complexity of the most common operations on a stack is:

âž” Access: O(n)
âž” Insertion: O(1)
âž” Deletion: O(1)
âž” Search: O(n)

Trees

âž” A recursive collection of nodes containing values
âž” Non-linear data structure, dynamic in size
âž” Values can be ordered and unordered
âž” Can contain unique and non unique values
âž” Can be balanced or unbalanced in height

Average time complexity of the most common operations on a balanced tree is:

âž” Access: O(log(n))
âž” Insertion: O(log(n))
âž” Deletion: O(log(n))
âž” Search: O(log(n))

Graphs

âž” Non-linear data structure, dynamic in size
âž” Consists of nodes (vertex) and edges between nodes
âž” Can store information on both edges and nodes
âž” Edges can be be directed or undirected
âž” Useful for modeling whatever relationship between data

Average time complexity of the most common operations on a graph represented as adjacency matrix is:

âž” Access: O(1)
âž” Search: O(1)
âž” Insertion: Edge: O(1), Vertex: O(|V|^2)
âž” Deletion: Edge: O(1), Vertex: O(|V|^2)

Hash tables

âž” Data structure mapping keys to values
âž” Math operations (hash function) maps each key to the spot with its value
âž” Unordered and dynamic in size
âž” Useful when quick lookup of values by keys is needed

Amortized time complexity of the most common operations on a hash table is:

âž” Access: O(1)
âž” Search: O(1)
âž” Insertion: O(1)
âž” Deletion: O(1)

Sets

âž” A kind of storage for unique values
âž” Dynamic in size
âž” Can be backed by a tree or a hash table
âž” Values can be ordered and unordered
âž” Useful for mantaining unique values of any kind
âž” The average time complexity is the one of the underlying structure
