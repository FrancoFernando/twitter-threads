Today I'd like to answer these questions:

â†¦ What are software design patterns?
â†¦ Why are they so important?
â†¦ How can you learn them?

{1/6} â†§

A design pattern:

âœ¦ describes a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem

âœ¦ defines the elements composing the solution and their relations

âœ¦ formalizes best practices of experienced engineers

âœ¦ comes always with its own trade-offs

{2/6}

Using design patterns has many advantages.

1. Provide a common vocabulary to talk about design.

If all team members are familiar with patterns, discussions about design get more productive.

They allow to express a lot of information in clearer and shorter sentences.

{3/6}

Improve code readability

If the usage of patterns is obvious in the code, a readers knowing the patterns can easily understand it.

3. Facilitate projects

Reusing widely tried and tested solutions reduce the technical risk and the development time of a project.

{4/6}

Help with refactoring

Using patterns as a guide in the refactoring process, it's easier to simplify the code and avoid overengineering.

5. Implement good design principles like SOLID

For example, the Strategy pattern can be used to apply the Open Closed Principle.

{5/6}

There are many design patterns, but you can find the main ones in the book:

ðŸ“˜ "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"

Another good book more beginner oriented is

ðŸ“˜ "Head First Design Patterns"
