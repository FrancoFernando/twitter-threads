As many people working in tech, I experienced impostor syndrome too.

But after 10+ years I learned some ways to combat and overcome it.

If you're experiencing impostor syndrome, here are 9 tips that will help: â†“

Identify and actively acknowledge your strengths.

Use them to boost your confidence and counterbalance any negative thought.

2. Give less importance to the people trying to put you down.

Give more importance to all the people that's supportive of you. Find a community or some friends / colleagues to honestly share experiences.

Be open with them and listen their feedback.

4. Work actively on your weaknesses.

Getting good at what you know you're not good at is a great way to gain confidence. Don't make meaningless comparisons.

Comparing yourself to someone much more experienced than you makes no sense.

Comparing yourself to someone having a totally different background makes no sense. Trust the interview process.

If a company hired you, trust that you didn't pass the interview process by mistake.

7. When a bad thing happen, think about its actual consequences.

Most of the time things aren't as bad as they seem and it's never the end of the world. Be grateful.

Everybody has things that should be grateful for. Take always them in mind.

This help to think differently about negative facts and to focus more on what is going well.

9. Consider that everybody else has or had impostor syndrome and that it's a normal fact.
