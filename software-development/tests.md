Tests make sure that changes to your code are working as expected.

But wait!

There are many kind of tests:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Unit
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Integration
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Functional
‚ñ∂Ô∏è End-to-end
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Acceptance
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Performance
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Smoke

Do you know how they differ and which you should use?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Unit tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è are very low level, close to the source code

‚ñ∂Ô∏è tests individual methods and functions of the classes or modules used by your software

‚ñ∂Ô∏è are easy to automate and can be run very quickly by a continuous integration server

2Ô∏è‚É£ Integration tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è check that different modules or services used by your application work well together

‚ñ∂Ô∏è i.e, they can test the interaction with the database

‚ñ∂Ô∏è are more expensive since they require multiple parts of the application to be up and running. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Functional tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è focus on the business requirements of an application

‚ñ∂Ô∏è only verify the output of an action without checking the intermediate states of the system

‚ñ∂Ô∏è i.e, they can test if the application get a specific value from the database according to requirements

4Ô∏è‚É£ End-to-end tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è replicates a user behavior with the software in a complete application environment

‚ñ∂Ô∏è verifies that various user flows work as expected

‚ñ∂Ô∏è are expensive to perform and hard to maintain when automated

‚ñ∂Ô∏è better having only a few key end-to-end tests

5Ô∏è‚É£ Acceptance tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è formal tests executed to verify if a system satisfies the business requirements

‚ñ∂Ô∏è like end-to-end tests focus on replicating user behaviors

‚ñ∂Ô∏è in addition measure also the performance of the system, rejecting changes if some goals are not met

6Ô∏è‚É£ Performance tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è non-functional tests checking the behaviors of the system under significant load

‚ñ∂Ô∏è i.e., observe the response times when executing a high number of requests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è are costly to implement and run, but useful to understand if new changes degrade the system

7Ô∏è‚É£ Smoke tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è quick to execute tests checking the basic functionality of the application

‚ñ∂Ô∏è useful after a new build befrore running more expensive tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è useful after a deployment to check that if the application is running properly
