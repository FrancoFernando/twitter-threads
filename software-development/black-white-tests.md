Black box and white box are 2️⃣ types of testing methods using a different approach.

▶️ black box testing focus on the WHAT

▶️ white box testing focus on the HOW

Are you confused on this software testing terminology?

Keep reading this thread. Focus

Black box focuses on testing functional requirements rather than internal requirements.

White box focuses on testing the program code, its control structure and procedural design. Knowledge

White box testing requires knowledge of the code design and implementation. Programming skills are a prerequisite for this type of testing.

Black box testing don't require that knowledge and can often be executed using a GUI without any programming knowledge. Size

Black box testing applies to a large part of the software.

White box testing applies to functions, classes and small group of modules. Use cases

Black box testing looks for:

- invalid or missing functions
- database access errors
- behaviour and performance errors

White box testing pays attention to:

- independent path execution
- logical decisions testing
- boundary condition of loops and functions

Examples

Black Box testing is usually performed by professional software testers and it includes:

- acceptance tests
- system tests

Black Box testing is performed by developers and it includes:

- integration tests
- unit tests
