ðŸ’™ C++ Smart Pointers ðŸ’™

Smart pointers implement explicit memory management according to RAII idiom.

When they go out of scope, their resources are automatically released.

There are 3 types of smart pointers:

â–¶ unique_ptr
â–¶ shared_ptr
â–¶ weak_ptr

What RAII means ?

It's an acronym for Resource Acquisition Is Initialization.

The acquisition and release of a resource by a smart pointer are bound to its lifetime.

The resource memory is allocated in the constructor and deallocated in the destructor. unique_ptr

â–¶ owns exclusively a resource

â–¶ automatically releases the resource if it goes out of scope

â–¶ canâ€™t be copied

â–¶ can be used in STL containers and algorithms



shared_ptr

â–¶ share the ownership of a resource

â–¶ keep 2 handler: for the resource and for its reference counter

â–¶ increase the counter +1 for every copy and

â–¶ decrease the counter -1 if the pointer goes out of scope

â–¶ release the resource when the counter is 0



weak_ptr

â–¶ not a real smart pointer

â–¶ borrows a resource from a shared_ptr withou increasing its reference counter

â–¶ useful mainly to break a cycle of shared_ptr
