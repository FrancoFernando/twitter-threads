Definition

These databases behave much like hash tables data structures.

They store collections of key-value pairs, mapping from keys to arbitrary values.

Both keys and values can be anything, ranging from simple objects like strings to complex compound objects. Pros

â€¢ Flexibility: no structure is imposed on the values

â€¢ Simplicity: is the less complex to use type of NoSQL database

â€¢ Speed: accessing values directly through keys means lower latency and higher throughput in the parts of the system where they're used

â€¢ Portability: easy to migrate between different systems

â€¢ Scalability: highly horizontally scalable compared to relational databases

Cons

â€¢ No query support: values can't be filtered using queries

After a request/update the whole value is returned/updated

â€¢ Mobility: without a unified query language, requests from a database may not be transportable to another key-value database

Use cases

Key-value storage can be used to:

â€¢ cache frequently accessed data (i.e. responses to network requests) and access them using a hash (i.e. IP address or username)

â€¢ store special configuration parameters used across the system

â€¢ access real time random data like user session attributes in web applications.

Sessions are marked with identifiers and all data recorded about each session are associated to their id. Popular implementations

â€¢ Dynamo DB: probably the most widely used key-value storage. Fully managed and serverless, It is part of the AWS portfolio.

â€¢ Zookeeper: a strongly consistent, high available key-value storage often used for dynamic configuration. â€¢ Redis: an in memory key-value storage. It offer some persistent storage option but used typically as fast, best effort caching solution.

â€¢ Etcd: a strongly consistent, high available key-value storage often used for implementing leader election.
