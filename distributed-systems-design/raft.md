Sometimes in distributed systems a node needs to act has a leader with special powers like:

- accessing shared resources
- assigning work to other nodes
- taking care of write operations

Raft is a popular algorithm to elect a leader.

How does it work ?

//Thread// â†“ {1/9}



Electing a leader in a distributed environment is not a trivial task.

Indeed a good leader election algorithm needs to have 2 features:

1. safety: at most one leader shall be active

2. liveness: a leader shall be elected even if failures occurr

{2/9}

Raft is a leader election algorithm that guarantees these properties.

It makes 2 assumptions.

The 1st one is that time is divided into slots of arbitrary length called election terms.

Terms are numbered using logical timestamps (e.g. consecutive integers).

The 2nd one is that at a given time each node can be in one of 3 states:

- the leader state
- the follower state
- the candidate state

This makes possible implementing the algorithm as a state machine.

{4/9}

A node in the follower state recognizes another node as a leader.

It expects to receive from the leader a periodic heartbeat with the term when it was elected.

If this is not received within a timeout the node moves to the candidate state.

{5/9}

A node in the candidate state increments the current term and starts a new election.

It sends to all other nodes a request to vote for it, specifying the current term.

It also votes for another candidate using a first comes first served policy.

{6/9}

At the beginning all nodes are followers.

They don't receive any heartbeat and move to candidates.

From a candidate point of view, an election finishes for 3 possible events.

1. The candidate is voted by the majority of the other nodes and becomes the leader.

{7/9}

The candidate receives an hearbeat from another node that won the election.

If the term specified in the hearthbeat is >= than the candidate current term:

- the other node is recognized as a leader
- the candidate moves to follower state

{8/9}

The election term time slot finishes without a candidate receiving the majority of the votes.

In this case a new election is started randomly choosing its duration within an interval.

This reduces the probability of another election without a winner.
