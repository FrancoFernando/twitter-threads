Competitive programming problems are one of my passions.

I've solved 1K+ problems only in the last 3 years.

Wanna know how this improved me ?

Here my 5 takeaways üßµ üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem solving skills

At the begining also easy problems look difficult.

But as you progress, you will be able to solve more complex problems almost effortlessly.

This came in handy also in other programming projects.

How ? üëá

First, I learned to find efficient and fast solutions for my programs.

Second, I reused many of the algorithms I applied to solve competitive programming problems also in real-life situations.

Especially knowing graphs and trees algorithms made the difference in many cases. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Thinking ability

Practicing competitive programming, helped me to get used to think quickly and act fast.

This also trained me to think carefully before committing to an action.

This translated into improving my productivity and working in a more effective way. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Interviews preparation

Competitive programming problems helped me to improve my DSA knowledge.

After a while, I felt more confident in solving the questions an interviewer commonly ask.

This reduced the time and the effort I needed while preparing for interviews. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Writing optimized code

In competitive programming, coding a correct solution is not enough.

Unoptimized solutions won‚Äôt pass the system tests even if they generate correct answers.

This forced me to always write optimal code so that this became instinctive. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reducing bug

In competitive programming, it is useless submitting buggy solutions.

So you really need to write correct code and test it against all possible bugs.

In the long term, this helped me to write code with less bug also in real projects.
