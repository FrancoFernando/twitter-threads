âš« Tips

1. Take advantage that you can access efficiently both ends of an array and use 2 pointers technique

2. Often brute force solution use O(n) space, but it's usually possible optimize to O(1)

3. Consider the possibility of overwriting an element instead of removing it

Pay attention to off-by-1 errors. They're very common

5. When integers are encoded into arrays, consider reversing the array to have the least significant digit at the beginning

6. Learn specific utilities for subarrays available in your programming language

Don't preserve the integrity of an input array untill not esplicitely required

8. Consider the possibility of using parallel logic for each dimansion in multidimensional arrays

9. Arrays can be also used to efficiently represent subsets
