Mock interviews are a good way to prepare for technical interviews.

Here 5 mock interviews services I've personally tried with their pro and cons.

// Thread // ↓↓

Pramp

A popular free service where in each session you alternate as both the interviewee and the interviewer.

You can practice there any type of technical interview.

Its downside is that sometimes you aren't matched with the right person wasting time. Expert Mitra

The service with the best value for money I've ever tried.

The interviewers are very professional and provide good feedbacks.

They really helped me in understanding my strength and weakness in design, coding and behavioral interviews.

Highly recommended. Gainlo

I tried this only once for coding interviews and the overall experience was positive.

I got a short feedback immediately at the end of the interview and detailed one by mail later on.

The interviewers are experienced, but the service is not very cheap. CareerCup

This service allows you to contact interviewers directly and schedule an appointment.

The selection of interviewers is very limited, but their quality is excellent.

I used it mainly for system design and I've learned a lot.

The only drawback is the price. TechMockInterview

I had great experience doing mock coding and systems design interviews with them.

People is generally very professional and able to provide good feedback on how to improve.

Interestingly they offer also a mentorship program, even if only in beta version.
