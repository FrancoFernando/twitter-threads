The core of competitive programming is design algorithms to solve a given problem.

But you don't need to reinvent the wheel.

Here 5 popular design techniques you can apply:

1. Brute Force
2. Divide and Conquer
3. Greedy
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Backtracking

Brute Force

It's the most basic approach.

→ Enumerate systematically all possible candidates for the solution.

→ Checks for each candidate if the problem's statement is satisfied.

→ Find always the optimal solution, but it doesn't scale with the input size. Divide and Conquer

It is a top-down approach and requires 3 steps:

→ Divide the original problem into a set of subproblems

→ Solve each subproblem individually and recursively

→ Combine the solution of the subproblems into a solution of the whole original problem. Greedy

It''s an approach to solve optimization problems.

→ The goal is maximize or minimize a value (or objective).

→ At each step makes the choice looking best to optimize the objective.

→ Not always produce the optimal solution, but usually a very close one. Dynamic Programming

It is a bottom-up approach.

→ Solve all possible small problems and combine them to get the solution for a bigger problem.

→ Helpful when subproblems overlaps and are exponentially large in number.

→ Often applicable to optimization problems. Backtracking

A depth-first search on the set of the possible solutions to a problem.

If a solution doesn't work during the search:

→ backtrack to a point of choice where different alternatives were presented

→ try the next alternative
