Short disclaimer.

This is a selection of my favourite problems concerning strings.

I tackled them and I think everyone can improve by gradually solving them.

I tried to put only string related problems, but some advanced ones require knowledge of topics like DP & tries. ðŸŸ¢ Easy

âš« Tips and Patterns

1. Take advantage that you can access efficiently both ends of a string and use 2 pointers technique

2. Often brute force solution use O(n) space, but it's usually possible optimize to O(1)

Instead of storing characters into a hash table, try to use a 256 fixed-length array. This simplifies the code and makes transparent the used amount of space

4. Languages like C# and Java provide a StringBuilder class to efficiently concatenate strings. Make use of it. Strings are immutable in many programming languages. Consider this when concatenating strings and learn to use alternatives like arrays/lists of chars.

6. Rolling hash is a specific technique used for string comparison. It's useful to efficiently solve some tricky problems. Learn how to refer to characters by their ASCII values, this is very common. For example how to:

â€¢ Get the ASCII value of a character
â€¢ Convert an ASCII value into a character
â€¢ Convert a digit character into its integer value

Sliding windows are a technique that come up a lot. It usually makes possible to improve the time complexity from quadratic to linear.

9. Learn how to implement tries for representing and storing a set of words. They are useful to solve advanced problems.
